This release aims to fix pending bugs and address stability.
A number of <a href="https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/commits/master">contributors</a> helped with patches and testing.

Note: the Mac executable requires OS X 10.6. I'm working on a 10.5 package; meanwhile, Mac Leopard users can use 0.7.2b.

<h4>New features:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>new advanced options to <i>customize extrusion width</i> for first layer, perimeters and infill</li>
    <li>new separate <b>speed setting for top solid surfaces</b></li>
    <li>new algorithm to <b>fill gaps</b> (corners, little regions, vase walls only allowing for an odd number of loops etc.)</li>
    <li>experimental support material generation for DLP in SVG export</li>
</ul>

<h4>Improvements:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>better detection of <i>thin walls</i></li>
    <li>avoid perimeter collisions</li>
    <li>accept both relative and absolute values for extrusion width, first layer speed, first layer height (relative values can be expressed as percentage, e.g. <i>80%</i>)</li>
    <li>allow to load multiple files at once in the plater</li>
    <li>always ask confirmation when overwriting existing STL files</li>
    <li>warn user when an object can't be split</li>
    <li>pass config options as environment variables to post-processing scripts</li>
</ul>

<h4>Changes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>renamed "Perimeters" to "Perimeters (minimum)" to avoid confusion caused by automatic additional perimeters</li>
    <li>renamed <i>bottom layer speed</i> to <i>first layer speed</i> for consistency</li>
    <li>always set bed temperature after first layer if first layer temperature is set</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bugfixes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>fixed regression causing many bridges to be extruded with a wrong direction</li>
    <li>fixed regression causing skirt to be limited to the first layer</li>
    <li>fixed regression causing some models not to be sliced correctly</li>
    <li>fixed regression causing SVG export to be incomplete</li>
    <li>arc compensation was applied to non-circular holes too, causing them to be too large</li>
    <li>retraction wasn't triggered when moving between infill of different islands using low density infill</li>
    <li>fixed <i>slic3r-console.exe</i> (on Windows) not working in previous 0.8.x releases</li>
    <li>Z wasn't lifted when changing layer</li>
    <li>the preview area was not updating to the largest side of the build plate</li>
    <li>the <i>Export SVG...</i> menu item was not working</li>
    <li>Growl notifications now work from the plater too</li>
</ul>

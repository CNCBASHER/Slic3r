This is a very important update: don't miss it and enjoy the goodies!

<h4>Major new features:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>a <b>new rock-solid slicing algorithm</b>, based on a topological approach, able to process efficiently a wide range of STL files without any warning</li>
    <li>generation of <b>support material</b> (optionally, with a <b>second extruder</b>)</li>
    <li><b>cooling</b> and <b>fan control</b></li>
    <li>ability to read the <b>AMF</b> format</li>
</ul>

<h4>New features:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>first layer temperature</b></li>
    <li>support for <b>Makerbot</b> and <b>Mach3</b> G-code flavors</li>
    <li>duplication is performed on generated toolpaths instead of 3D mesh, resulting in a <b>nearly-constant time</b> for any number of object copies</li>
    <li>infill and support material are <b>multi-threaded</b>, so they will take advantage of multiple CPUs/cores</li>
    <li>support for custom post-processing scripts</li>
    <li>new notes field in configuration profiles</li>
</ul>

<h4>Improvements:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>uses 40% less memory</li>
    <li>ability to load multiple config files using the command line</li>
    <li>ask for confirmation when slicing more than one copy</li>
    <li>contours and holes are extruded in the same direction (ccw)</li>
    <li>skein multiple files with a single command from command line</li>
    <li>some compensation for hole shrinkage</li>
</ul>

<h4>Minor improvements:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>do not display the progress dialog as an application-wide modal dialog</li>
    <li>Config files are now portable between Unix and Windows and allow for Unicode characters</li>
    <li>added extrusion multiplier to G-code comments</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bugfixes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>models with rounded walls had small useless infill regions</li>
    <li>small perimeter speed was applied to all holes too, regardless of their size</li>
    <li>fixed some fatal errors</li>
</ul>

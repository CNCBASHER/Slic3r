This is a very important update, grab it now and enjoy!
I want to say thanks to the wonderful community that has been helping with feedback, early testing and nice ideas. A lot of people is involved in our open "quality assurance" process!

<h4>New features:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>graphical interface for composing multiple objects</b> in one single print (with tools for rotation, scaling etc.)</li>
    <li>new <b>--merge</b> switch to compose multiple object with auto-positioning from command line</li>
    <li>new option to <b>randomize starting points</b> across layers</li>
    <li>automatic detection of additional required perimeters for avoiding haps in domed/sloping objects (the <i>perimeters</i> settings means now <i>minimum perimeters</i> as Slic3r could add more when needed)</li>
    <li><b>sequential printing</b>: print a complete object, then move onto next one, with automatic collision detection</li>
    <li>ability to <b>export STL</b> files of composed plates, as well as a <b>Split</b> command to turn multi-object files into individual objects</li>
    <li>we can read <b>OBJ</b> files now</li>
</ul>

<h4>Improvements:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>very large memory savings</b> and speed boosts, allowing to process high-resolutions files without getting out of memory; also, the number of threads is customizable</li>
    <li>very <b>improved surface quality</b> due to new smoothing algorithms</li>
    <li>the GUI doesn't block while slicing and a <b>Cancel</b> button was added to stop the process</li>
    <li>hole perimeters are extruded in reverse order (from the outermost to the innermost) to get better overhangs</li>
    <li>a slight compensation is applied to avoid small hole shrinkage</li>
    <li>support material now uses honeycomb pattern (much work is still needed on support material)</li>
    <li>retract before changing tool for dual extrusion</li>
</ul>

<h4>Changes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>SVG colors were inverted to better support DLP printing (next versions will carry more settings for SVG export)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bugfixes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>fixed some GUI memory leaks</li>
    <li>fixed some fatal errors</li>
    <li>fixed a bug causing high memory consumption when infilling every 2 or more layers</li>
    <li>some holes where filled</li>
    <li>some nearly-thin walls were discarded</li>
    <li>removed tiny dots/blobs that were generated sometimes</li>
    <li>bottom layer speed ratio wasn't taken into account when estimating layer time</li>
    <li>omit any G92 E0 when in relative mode</li>
</ul>

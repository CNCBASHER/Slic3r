<p>Joachim Glauche, owner of <a href="http://www.reprapsource.com/">RepRapSource.com</a> and creator of the <a href="http://www.shapercube.com/">ShaperCube</a> published some <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/102048359095706720847/Prints">pictures of nice high-resolution prints</a> sliced thanks to the speed and accuracy of Slic3r.<br>

<p>Some people printed the same object with Slic3r and Skeinforge and published pictures with the comparison: see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blue_metal/6341424872"> this picture</a> by Blue_Metal, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/13659531@N03/6334203975/">this one</a> by John Ridley.

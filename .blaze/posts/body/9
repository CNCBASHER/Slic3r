<h4>New features:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><i>Slice and save as...</i> command to <b>choose the output file name</b></li>
    <li>Compatibility with Windows XP 64</li>
    <li>Total filament length is written to the output file and showed on command line</li>
</ul>

<h4>Improvements:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Improved flow and overlapping for solid surfaces</b> by using a better physical model in internal calculations; this gives much <b>higher quality</b> making it less sparse then it was before</li>
    <li>Improved the slicing algorithm; this should <b>reduce the STL warnings</b></li>
    <li>Better overlapping for loops</li>
    <li>Concentric infill now uses the adjusted flow spacing for better surface quality; it also starts infilling always from the center point.</li>
    <li><b>Reduced packages size</b> by 10-20%; they also launch faster</li>
    <li>Always use rectilinear infill for internal solid surfaces</li>
    <li>Limit skirt height to print height</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bugfixes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Concentric infill was throwing errors</li>
    <li>Extrusion was calculated incorrectly for clock-wise arcs when using the experimental <i>--gcode-arcs</i> option</li>
</ul>

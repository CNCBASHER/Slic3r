<p>Okay, Slic3r was born in September and in a few months I was able to bring it beyond what I expected, in terms of features, speed and stability. Things have started to <b>change very quickly</b>, and <b>community</b> is playing a big role in testing and discussing new features.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/list.php?263"><b>Slic3r forum</b></a> was created in the official RepRap forums. Also, about 50 people sit in the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">FreeNode</a> IRC #slic3r channel.</p>

<p>Some notable things appeared in the web recently. Neil Underwood (well known as <a href="http://repraplogphase.blogspot.com/">Spacexula</a>) posted pictures and a video of a print he did on the <a href="http://blog.reprap.org/2011/12/001-layer-height-on-prusa-mendel.html">official RepRap blog</a>. The first outstanding thing is that he reached a <b>0.01mm layer height</b>. The second outstanding thing is that <b>he used Slic3r</b>!</p>

<p>Richard H. (well known as <a href="http://richrap.blogspot.com/">Richrap</a>) is posting a multipart <a href="http://richrap.blogspot.com/2012/01/slic3r-is-nicer-part-1-settings-and.html"><b>illustrated Slic3r guide</b></a> to his colorful blog. It's a very good work, so thank you Rich!</p>

<p>Michael Andresen (well known as <a href="http://captain-slow.dk/">blddk</a>) posted <a href="http://captain-slow.dk/2011/12/29/slic3r-fill-options/
http://captain-slow.dk/2011/12/29/slic3r-fill-options/">some screenshots</a> to show differences between the various <b>fill patterns</b> available in Slic3r. Don't miss the interesting article Gary Hodgson posted about <a href="http://garyhodgson.com/reprap/2012/01/thoughts-on-fill-algorithms/">new possible fill patterns</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://techpaladin.com/">Pointedstick</a> (Nathaniel Graham) posted two good blog articles about <b>high-resolution printing</b>, in which he talks about using Slic3r: <a href="http://techpaladin.com/2011/11/21/getting-all-the-pieces-to-fit-together/">this</a> and <a href="http://techpaladin.com/2011/12/21/nathaniels-guide-to-high-detail-printing/">that</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://brazenartifice.wordpress.com/">Brazen Artifice</a> posted a couple articles about <a href="http://brazenartifice.wordpress.com/2011/12/31/retraction-solution-with-marlin-pronterface-and-slic3r/">retraction</a> and <a href="http://brazenartifice.wordpress.com/2011/12/05/teaching-slic3r-to-remember-your-settings/">preloading last settings</a>.

<p>Sparr posted a picture of an <a href="http://blog.freesideatlanta.org/2011/12/reprap-firmware-comparison-smoother.html">object he printed</a> with and without enabling the <b>native arcs support</b> in Slic3r.</p>

<p>The good <a href="https://github.com/kliment">Kliment Yanev</a> added an option to customize the slicing command in his excellent <a href="https://github.com/kliment/Printrun">Pronterface</a>, to allow for easy <b>integration with Slic3r</b>. (See the <a href="https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/blob/master/README.markdown">Slic3r README</a> for guidance.)</p>
